# Vue.js LocalStorage Notes App with Theme Toggle

## Overview  
**Vue.js LocalStorage Notes App with Theme Toggle** is a client-side note-taking application built with **Vue.js**.  
It allows users to create timestamped notes, store them in the browser's **localStorage**, and manage them with a responsive interface.  
A built-in **theme toggle** feature lets users switch between different visual styles instantly.

This project showcases component-driven UI development and persistent client-side storage without any backend.
